# Varlog 

Varlog is a strongly consistent distributed log storage. It enables many
distributed systems to leverage total-ordered logs to support transactional
event processing with high performance, and simplify the building the complex
distributed systems.

## Installation

With Go module support, add the following import to your code.

```go
import "github.daumkakao.com/varlog/varlog"
```

## Usage

```go
// Open the log.
vlog, _ := varlog.Open(context.Background(), clusterID, mrAddrs)

// Write records to the log.
vlog.Append(context.Background(), topicID, [][]byte{[]byte("hello"), []byte("varlog")})

// Read records from the log.
closer, _ := vlog.Subscribe(context.Background(), topicID, begin, end, func(logEntry varlogpb.LogEntry, err error) {
    fmt.Println(logEntry)
})
defer closer()
```
